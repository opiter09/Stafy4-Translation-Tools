# Stafy4-Translation-Tools
These files are designed to split apart Densetsu no Stafy 4 to make translation easier. Eventually, they will further split the files into smaller files for each
dialogue, and handle combining them and doing all the pointers for you. For now, there's just some bare-bones extraction.

To use this, split apart the ROM with CrystalTile2 (https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/818/), then place the scripts in STAFY4/FSI.CT and run them.
